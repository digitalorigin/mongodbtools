RMongo
----

This is a R package which lets you query MongoDB databases.

The original package was made by @tommychheng
Check: http://github.com/tc/RMongo

However, this package does not contains any code of that package anymore.

At the very beginning, I just wanted to add SSL feature, but at the end I started from scratch.
