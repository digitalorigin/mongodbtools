Title: MongoDB Client for R
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2016-06-29
Author: Roc Alabern, Sergio Guirado, Tommy Chheng
Maintainer: Roc Alabern <roc.alabern@gmail.com>
Description: MongoDB Database interface for R. The interface is provided via
    Java calls to the mongo-java-driver. We modified Chheng version in order to fit
    our requirements. Actually we are not using any of the original code, but it
    inspired us to develop this. Since the code it is so different we renamed it to mongodbtools.
